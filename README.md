# PassengerKI
A plugin (work in progress) to allow your player to enter any vehicle as passenger. Even empty ones. 
Other features follow...


## Usage
The plugin will allow you to command an already existent driver to drive you to a location on the map you have specified via marker. 
If your car has no driver (mainly because it is empty) you can press the Enter-Keys again in order to spawn a driver that will enter the vehicle and after that can be commanded to drive you to your desired location.

This also works for air type vehicles like choppers. You can customize the driver outfit in the settings INI file (PassengerKI.ini) as well as any Keybinds used. 
Below are the default keybinds and settings.  See the settings file for more options. 

### Enter as Passenger
Keyboard: Press <kbd>E</kbd> <br>
Controller: Press <kbd>DPadDown</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>

### Spawn Driver (while in passenger seat)
Keyboard: Press <kbd>E</kbd> <br>
Controller: Press <kbd>DPadDown</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> <br>
Press <kbd>E</kbd> again to tell the driver to exit the vehicle and leave you alone.

### Drive To Marker
Keyboard: Press <kbd>Space</kbd> <br>
Controller: Press <kbd>DPadLeft</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> <br>
Press Space again to update the route at any time.

Change Keybinds in the PassengerKI.ini
